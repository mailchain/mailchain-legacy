# Mailchain

You will be able to communicate with any web3 address with Mailchain. That means you can send and receive messages to and from blockchain addresses (aka accounts or wallets). 

Itâ€™s just like email but weâ€™re convinced itâ€™s better, itâ€™s built for web3 but with a frenly user experience. You get a familiar inbox with:

- End-to-end encryption
- Decentralised object storage (IPFS, etc.)
- Name registries (ENS, etc)
- Is multi-protocol
- And... much more ðŸš€
