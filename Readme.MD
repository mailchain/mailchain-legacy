# Mailchain LEGACY - [DEPRECATED]

In the early days of Mailchain’s development we used the code in this legacy branch to send messages on chain. It’s kept for reference and educational purposes only. This branch is NOT being worked on, will NOT have security fixes applied, and should NOT be used. You can find the latest developments on the [main branch](https://github.com/mailchain/mailchain).
